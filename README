Video data is output from SSI. Interrupts and DMA provide data to SSI.
A timer triggers DMA which fills the SSI FIFO. Then an interrupt starts
SSI DMA for the rest of the line. Another interrupt happens once per
line, keeps track of vertical position, and performs setup for each line.

The frame buffer is in 16 bit little endian format, with most significant
bit being sent first. This means that compared to the usual arrangement,
both bits in a byte and pairs of bytes are reversed. This conversion
may be accomplished via img2fb.c.

A frame buffer is not included. One may be created from any image.
First, convert the image to .mono format using ImageMagick, and crop
to 496x640. Then, supply that file as an argument to img2fb and redirect
output to fb.h.
